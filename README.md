# 🧠 Agentic AI Learning Journey

This repository documents my personal learning journey through building agentic AI systems using Python, inspired by the excellent [Agentic AI Engineering Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-agentic-ai-engineering-course/) by **Ed Donner**.

Rather than forking the original repo, I chose to start from scratch to:
- Reinforce concepts through hands-on Python practice
- Track my progress using clean, modular `.py` files instead of Jupyter notebooks
- Build a practical, reusable agent toolkit as I go

Each lab file explores a key concept in agentic AI design such as:
- System vs. user prompt dynamics
- Multi-turn conversational agents
- Tool use and memory loops
- Self-evaluating agents
- Chain-of-thought prompting
- Custom agent architectures

## 🚀 Motivation

This repo is more than a course follow-along — it’s a practical foundation to:
- Build my agent engineering skillset
- Design reusable components for future LLM projects
- Share learnings with the AI/dev community

---

## 📅 Commit Pattern

I aim to push **frequent, focused commits**. Each script is self-contained, well-commented, and tested.  
Where possible, I include variations, edge-case tests, and agent behavior notes.

## 🧠 Acknowledgements

- **Course:** [The Complete Agentic AI Engineering Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-agentic-ai-engineering-course/)
- **Instructor:** [Ed Donner](https://www.linkedin.com/in/edonner/)

While this project builds on the course structure, all code, commentary, and experiments in this repo are my own.

## 🔒 API Keys & Secrets

All API keys (e.g. OpenAI) are managed via `.env` files and are excluded from version control using `.gitignore`.
