       "    **LangChain** is a widely adopted open-source framework that enables developers to build applications powered by large language models (LLMs). Its modular design allows for the integration of various components, including prompt templates, agent modules for task automation, memory systems for context retention, and dynamic retrieval components for real-time data access. LangChain supports multiple LLMs and offers a rich ecosystem of tools, making it suitable for applications such as conversational agents, document analysis, and code generation.

       "    \n",
       "    **LangGraph**, built upon LangChain, focuses on creating stateful, graph-based AI agent systems that can incorporate human intervention. It employs a graph-based approach to define the workflow of prompts and agent interactions, offering explicit control over the flow of information and allowing for branching and debugging of complex agent behaviors. LangGraph is ideal for applications requiring complex customer service flows with escalation paths to human agents and guided decision-making systems.
